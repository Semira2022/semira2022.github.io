    <h1>The Growth in Slavery of 1587-1777</h1>
    <h2>by Semira Daniels</h2>
   <left>
     <txt>During this period of 1587-1777, there has been an major increase of slavery since it's our Masters' only source of profit.</txt>
     <txt>It all started around the early 1500's when John Hawkins, a naval commander had came up with the triangular trade system.</txt>
     <txt>Ever since the English have stolen us from our homes and thrown us on ships to tranport us to a new land for us to do everything for them.</txt>
     <txt>The English had started taking us around 1619.</txt>
     <txt>There was around 250-600 of us on one ship. All of us are coming to this new land.</txt>
     <txt>They had traded us and other raw materials for other people that were referred to as Pequot Indians.</txt>  
     <txt>Then the colonists in Massachuesets had made it legal to hold us captive on this new land for many moons in 1641.</txt>
     <txt>By the 1700's on this new land we had dicovered a famililar crop in south carolina.</txt>
     <txt>The discovery of the crop had made us become overworked. So, the masters had brought more slaves to help with the amount of work.</txt>
     <txt>By 1710 the Europeans were outnumbered to the slaves.</txt>
     <txt>Next, plaintations were introduced by the South Carolinians.</txt>
