    <h2>by Semira Daniels</h2>

     <txt>During this period of 1587-1777, there has been an major increase of slavery since it's our Masters' only source of profit.</txt>
     <txt>It all started around the early 1500's when John Hawkins, a naval commander had came up with the triangular trade system.</txt>
     <txt>Ever since the English have stolen us from our homes and thrown us on ships to tranport us to a new land for us to do everything for them.</txt>
     <txt>The English had started taking us around 1619.</txt>
     <txt>There was around 250-600 of us on one ship. All of us are coming to this new land.</txt>
     <txt>They had traded us and other raw materials for other people that were referred to as Pequot Indians.</txt>

   <br>
     <txt>Then the colonists in Massachuesets had made it legal to hold us captive on this new land for many moons in 1641.</txt>
     <txt>By the 1700's on this new land we had dicovered a famililar crop in South Carolina.</txt>
     <txt>The discovery of the crop had made us become overworked. So, the masters had brought more slaves to help with the amount of work.</txt>
   <br>
     <txt>Next, plaintations were introduced by the South Carolinians.</txt>
   <br>
     <txt>By 1710, the Europeans were outnumbered to the slaves.</txt>
     <txt>Once the Europeans where outnumbered, the authorities of the Carolinas had started to get involved and they had started lynching, beating, and killing us.</txt>
     <txt>In order to lower our population they had punished us for them to decrease our population therefore they would'nt be the minority.</txt>
     <txt>They had punished us for freedom of movement (gatherings), assembles at funerals, earning money, and the knowledge of how to read or write.</txt>
   <br>

       <txt>In 1738, Flordia had promised that all the runaway slaves would be free there.</txt> 
       <txt>So on September 9th of 1739, a african slave, with the name of Jemmy. Had led a march with over 100 other slaves from Stono, SC to Flordia.</txt>    
       <txt>Jemmy and his crew had killed alot of the white men. The event was later called the Stono Rebellion.</txt>
       <br>
       <txt>Flordia had became the first southern state to abolish slavery, and then Georgia was the last.</txt>
