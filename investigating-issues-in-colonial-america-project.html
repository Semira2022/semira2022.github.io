     <txt>During this period of 1587-1777 there has been an major increase of slavery since it's our Masters' only source of profit.</txt>
     <txt>It all started around the early 1500's when John Hawkins, a naval commander had came up with the triangular trade system. Ever since the English have stolen us from our homes and throw us on a boat to do everything for them.</txt>
     <txt>Then they had made it legal to hold us captive on this new land for many moons </txt>
